# IDM_Confidence
Analysis of perceptual (CPDM) and value-based (CRDM and CDD) decision making and confidence data for IDM.

We are using this repository to collect various scripts being written for the purpose of analyzing confidence data collected via the Interoception Decision Making (IDM) protocol. 

So far we have three scripts

## Confidence Distribution

The Jupyter Python notebook Reported_Confidence_Distribution.ipynb displays a general distribution of the confidence metrics in terms of mean and standard deviations of the reported confidence measures

## Correlation analysis

The Jupyter Python notebooks Correlation_SDAN.ipynb and Correlation_CloudResearch.ipynb summarize the correlation between meta_uncertainties and ambiguity_aversion parameter. Meta uncertainties were estimated for CPDM, CRDM, and CDD. In these scripts, we estimate correlation across these tasks with pearson and spearman coefficients.
